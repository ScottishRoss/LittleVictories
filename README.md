<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Little Victories Screenshot](https://github.com/ScottishRoss/LittleVictories/blob/master/Images/full.png?raw=true)

Everyday life is full of Little Victories, the small steps that we don't always celebrate as we should. We look to the big wins and we judge ourselves by achieving milestones, rather than congratulating ourselves for small moments of progress towards our goals.

Especially fo those of us who struggle with depression and other mental illnesses, it can be hard to celebrate those Little Victories that actually mean more than we let ourselves believe.

Little Victories is designed to help us quickly input a Victory that we want to celebrate, and help us reinforce to ourselves the importance of what we do every day.

Celebrate your Little Victories such as:
- going for a walk
- preparing and eating a meal
- socialising with friends
And many more Victories that will be personal to you!

As you can see, there are so many achievements that we forget to recognise every day, and we should remind ourselves just how many times we succeed in doing "something" every day. For those of us who struggle with depression, it's very important that we remind ourselves that we are successful more often than we let ourselves believe, and these Little Victories should be noted and celebrated.

This app was developed utilising my experiences with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and the book "The Compassionate Mind".
